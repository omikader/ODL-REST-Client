ODLClientPutFlow.java - a program that sends a REST call to install a specified flow (in JSON format) from an 
SDN switch located on the network.

- To build and run this program, run as:

./put_flow.sh <node_id> <table_id> <flow_id> <json_flow.txt>

<node_id> : the openflow switch ID (denoted by "openflow:<#############>")
<table_id> : the flow table that the flow belongs to, normally 0
<flow_id> : the ID of the flow that was assigned when it was created
<json_flow.txt> : the flow to add, in json format, in a .txt file (see examples)
